<h3 id="c2">INTRODUCTION</h3>
<p>D.A.R. State Park is located in western Vermont on State Highway
17, approximately 1 mile north of Lake Champlain (toll) Bridge (see
map, <a href="#fig1">Fig. 1</a>). The park, which fronts on Lake Champlain, contains undeveloped
acres on the east side of the Highway. Tenting, leanto camping,
picnicking and swimming are adequately provided for during the
summer months.</p>
<p>This park, more than most others, not only awakens the visitor&rsquo;s
curiosity about the past history of the Earth, but satisfies it. The story
of an ancient sea and the life which existed in it can be read from the
rocks exposed in D.A.R. State Park. You can read this story for yourselves.
This Pamphlet is designed as an aid to a more complete understanding
of the observations which you make. &ldquo;Reading the rock record&rdquo;
is not difficult, but the geologist does have the advantage of possessing
a certain trained scientific approach to these problems. This method
of approach, the &ldquo;tools of the trade,&rdquo; will now be passed on to you.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_6">6</div>
<h3 id="c3">THE GEOLOGY OF THE PARK</h3>
<p>The park beach is the ideal place to study the rocks of the park,
for here the rocks are best exposed and can be easily examined at close
range. The attitude of the rock layers can be seen on a walk down the
ramp. By attitude is meant their relationship to an imaginary horizontal
plane, which for our purposes is the level of the lake. Are the rock layers
parallel to the surface of Lake Champlain or do they slant or dip into
it? If the layers were parallel to the surface they would not &ldquo;dip.&rdquo; The
dip of the park strata (layers) is seen in <a href="#fig2">Figure 2</a>. Dip is expressed in
the number of degrees <i>down</i> from the horizontal and here the dip is
toward the west and is measured to be between 8 and 11 degrees. The
dip is always measured perpendicular to an imaginary horizontal line
on a rock layer called a &ldquo;strike line.&rdquo; The average &ldquo;strike,&rdquo; or compass
direction of the &ldquo;strike line&rdquo; is 22 degrees east of <i>north</i>.<a class="fn" id="fr_1" href="#fn_1">[1]</a></p>
<p><i>Sedimentary rocks</i><a class="fn" id="fr_2" href="#fn_2">[2]</a> crop out on the park beach. These were originally
lime mud resting on the sea bottom. Under continued pressure from
the overlying sediments resulting from continued deposition and burial,
the muds were slowly compacted and cemented into the hard limestones
and limy shales which we see today. The many layers of rock were then
tilted. Tilted layers tell the geologist of giant earth movements which
took place since their formation. The story of these movements will be
developed later in this pamphlet.</p>
<p>As you look at the tilted rock layers from the ramp, can you tell
which layers are the oldest, that is, those first deposited as lime muds
on the sea bottom? A basic geologic law, the Law of Superposition,
states that if a series of sedimentary layers have <i>not</i> been overturned,
the oldest is on the bottom and the youngest on top. Assuming that the
layers which you are looking at have not been overturned, those on your
left (south) are the oldest and those on your right (north) the youngest.
Looking at <a href="#fig2">Figure 2</a>, taken from the ramp-bottom toward the north, the
layers in the foreground are older than those in the distance. Let us take
a close look at the individual layers of rock and delve deeper into the
story that they have to tell.</p>

<p>Search the top of a few layers and you will notice many shell and
other animal impressions. Do they represent animals which lived hundreds
of millions of years ago or were they washed onto these rocks
from present-day Lake Champlain? If you try to make a collection of
the shell impressions you will see that they are a part of the rock and
therefore must represent remains of animals that were buried in the
<span class="pb" id="Page_8">8</span>
ancient lime muds. These preserved <i>remains</i><a class="fn" id="fr_3" href="#fn_3">[3]</a>
are called fossils. The
geologist who specializes in the study of fossils is called a <i>paleontologist</i>.
You may ask, &ldquo;What can fossils tell me about the past?&rdquo; In the first
place, fossils tell us at what time in the past the sediments in which they
are found were deposited. In this way, the <i>relative age</i><a class="fn" id="fr_4" href="#fn_4">[4]</a>
of the rock layers found in the Park can be learned. Secondly, the environment or
surroundings in which these ancient sediments were deposited can be
reconstructed from the types of fossils contained within them. Certain
animals living today are quite similar to those in the Park rocks and
their environment in today&rsquo;s sea can be used to reconstruct the environment
of animals which lived in the past. The characteristics of the
rocks and their relation to adjacent rocks are considered in any reconstruction
of past environment. In the third place, the study of fossils is
a mainstay of the theory of evolution. That is to say, changes in fossil
forms collected from groups of successively younger rock layers document
the theory that life has evolved little by little since its first appearance
on Earth. Finally, it should be mentioned that some animals found
as fossils are not living today and have not lived, to the best of our
knowledge, for millions of years. Why did these forms of life die out?
What set of circumstances led to their extinction? The answers to these
questions are not easy to find and they are highly speculative.</p>

<h3 id="c4">THE FOSSILS</h3>
<p>Many groups of invertebrates are represented in the fossils of D.A.R.
State Park. <a href="#imgx5">Plate 1</a> will help you to identify these fossils. The name,
phylum (major group) and age of each fossil are provided in the explanation
of the plate. The following paragraphs describe each phylum
represented in the Park rocks.</p>

<p><i>Arthropods.</i> D.A.R. State Park rocks contain trilobites with the following
imposing names: <i>Cryptolithus tesselatus</i>
(crip-toe-LITH-us tessell-AH-tus<a class="fn" id="fr_5" href="#fn_5">[5]</a>),
<i>Isotelus gigas</i> (ice-so-TELL-us GIG-us) and <i>Flexicalymene
senaria</i> (flex-eye-cal-ah-Mean-ee sen-AREA). These fossils are
figured on <a href="#imgx5">Plate 1</a>, 1-A, B, C, D; 2; 3. Within the Park <i>Cryptolithus
tesselatus</i> is very common wherever fossils occur. Generally only the
cephalon or head portion of this trilobite is preserved. The cephalon is
<span class="pb" id="Page_11">11</span>
easily recognized by three concentric rows of pits arranged around the
brim. <i>Cryptolithus</i> is an excellent <i>index fossil</i><a class="fn" id="fr_6" href="#fn_6">[6]</a>
for the Park rocks. The arthropod phylum is characterized by animals with jointed legs,
segmented bodies and a jointed outer armour of <i>chitin</i>.<a class="fn" id="fr_7" href="#fn_7">[7]</a> For examples, the
crabs, lobsters, spiders, scorpions and insects are arthropods. Trilobites
appear early in the fossil record but they did not survive beyond the
Paleozoic Era.</p>

<p><i>Brachiopods.</i> Brachiopods are abundant in the Park rocks (see <a href="#imgx5">Plate 1</a>,
4A, B; 5; 6; 9; 10; 11; 12). These invertebrates are small marine
animals which generally live in waters no deeper than 600 feet. The
two valves of their shell are joined at the back (posterior) end of the
body along a hingeline of interlocking teeth and sockets. The shell of
the brachiopod is opened or shut by muscles attached to the inside of
each valve. Brachiopods are found in the oldest rocks containing definite
and abundant fossils. Brachiopods are still living today.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_13">13</div>
<p><i>Bryozoans.</i> Bryozoans or &ldquo;moss animals&rdquo; are very small marine animals

Large colonies of the fossil Prasopora (prah-sop-OR-ah) are commonly
seen on the weathered surfaces of many of the rock layers in the Park
(see <a href="#imgx5">Plate 1</a>; 7A, B, C; 8 and <a href="#fig5">Figure 5</a>). Individuals of one genus common
here, can be recognized by their chocolate drop shapes. Bryozoans
first appear in lower Paleozoic rocks and are still living today in clear
well-circulated shallow to deep marine water. Considering all of the
fossils found in the Park rocks, the past environment is thought to have
been a relatively shallow and warm sea.</p>

<h3 id="c5">THE ROCKS AND THEIR HISTORY</h3>
<p>Approximately 75 vertical feet of the Glens Falls Limestone occur
along the Park beach. The rocks are <i>black</i><a class="fn" id="fr_8" href="#fn_8">[8]</a> or blue-black on a fresh
surface, gray or grayish-white on a surface which has been exposed to
the weather. Most of the individual beds or layers are 5 to 7 inches
thick (see <a href="#fig6">Fig. 6</a>) with the thickest being just under 5 feet. The beds are
separated by thin &ldquo;partings&rdquo; of rock, many of which contain abundant
fossils. The beds consist of massive limestone, shaly limestone or limy
shale; the partings are generally limy shale or shaly limestone.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_15">15</div>
<div class="box">
<p class="center"><b><span class="large"><i>Explanation for <a href="#fig7">Figure 7</a></i></span></b></p>
<p>1. Glens Falls and younger sediments were deposited on the Ordovician sea floor.</p>
<p>2. Sediments hardened into Glens Falls Limestone and younger rocks.</p>
<p>3. Rocks were tilted during the late Ordovician Taconic Disturbance and the
younger rocks and part of the Glens Falls Limestone were removed by erosion.
Erosion continued for some 350 million years.</p>
<p>4. During the Pleistocene Epoch, which started some 1 million years ago, glacial
ice overrode the beveled layers of the Glens Falls Limestone. Hard rocks
frozen to the underside of the glacial ice produced scratches or striations in
the exposed layers of the Glens Falls Limestone.</p>
<p>5. Glacial lakes Vermont form as the glaciers retreat northward. In between the
glacial lakes Vermont and present Lake Champlain, marine waters flooded
the valley and formed an arm of the Atlantic Ocean. Clay, silt, sand and
gravel were deposited on glaciated Glens Falls Limestone (<a href="#imgx4">Fig. 1a</a>).</p>
<p>6. Present-day Lake Champlain formed when relatively greater uplift in the
north dammed the Champlain valley.</p>
</div>
<p>The rock types found in the Park lead to certain conclusions regarding
the environment which existed during their formation. Most of
the rocks are composed of lime (limestone) or a mixture of lime, fine
sand and mud (limy shale or shaly limestone). The mineral pyrite
(FeS&#8322;) is present in many of the rocks. Most of the rocks contain
abundant amounts of organic matter. The sediments which make up
these rocks were carried to the Ordovician sea by streams flowing primarily
from the east. As these streams entered the quiet sea waters the
larger followed by the smaller particles began to settle to the bottom.
Lime was slowly precipitated from the warm sea water and pyrite formed
under stagnant bottom conditions. Organic material accumulated on the
bottom and intermixed with the sediments. The poor life-sustaining
qualities of much of the bottom waters prevented rapid or complete
bacterial action on the accumulated debris and the sediments remained
&ldquo;organic black&rdquo; in color. Slowly, as the weight of overlying sediments
increased, the lower layers were compacted and cemented into the hard
limestone and shale which we see today.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_16">16</div>
<p>The tilt or dip of the Park rocks resulted from subsequent earth
movements. When were these rocks tilted? From the evidence presented
in the Park all that can be said is that they were tilted sometime after
hardening and before the Pleistocene glaciers overrode the region during
quite recent times (at least 10,000 years ago). Thus, there are some
350 million years of rock record missing in the Park. Can we tell what
happened during these &ldquo;missing&rdquo; years through a study of only the
Park rocks? The answer to this question is partially &ldquo;yes,&rdquo; but we must
look to the work done in adjacent areas for a more complete story.</p>
<p>The mere fact that there are no rocks representing these millions
of years tells us that the sea had withdrawn from the area and that
the previously deposited rocks were undergoing erosion during most or
all of the missing rock gap (the time not represented by rocks). Information
from adjacent areas, however, tells us that the Park rocks were
tilted during the Taconic Disturbance which occurred during the final
stages of the Ordovician Period. East of the Park, Taconic earth movements
are more dramatically exhibited. The rocks are tilted even more
than in the Park and are broken by faults or cracks in the earth&rsquo;s crust.
Some of these faults, known as thrust faults, positioned giant slabs of
rock far from their original locations and placed older on top of
younger rocks.</p>
<p>Following these earth movements there occurred a long period of
erosion. Many of the rock layers were stripped off and carried piece by
piece by rivers to other regions. Hundreds of millions of years passed
and then, less than one million years ago the great glacial ice sheets
slowly advanced southward over the Park area. Pieces of hard rock
frozen to the underside of the ice sheets scratched and scraped the rock
surfaces leaving these scratches or striations for us to see today (near
the northern end of the Park beach these striations are common on the
outcropping rock). The retreating glaciers created a series of lakes in
which clay, silt, sand and gravel were deposited. Today these sediments
are found resting on the beveled edges of the Park rocks.</p>
<p>Present-day Lake Champlain owes its existence to a general uplift
of the earth&rsquo;s surface, greater in the north than in the south, perhaps
due to the removal of the heavy glacial ice sheet from the area. The
greater uplift in the north dammed the Champlain valley which slowly
filled with water. For a diagrammatic picture of the geologic history of
D.A.R. State Park, see <a href="#fig7">Figure 7</a>.</p>

<h3 id="c8">INTRODUCTION</h3>
<p>Mt. Philo State Forest Park, consisting of some 160 acres, is located
about 15 miles south of Burlington and 1 mile east of U.S. Route 7
(see map, <a href="#fig1">Fig. 1</a>). This park is noted for its scenic views, especially of
the broad Champlain Valley and the rugged Adirondack Mountains beyond
(see <a href="#imgx2">cover</a> picture and <a href="#imgx6">Fig. 7a</a>). From a 46-foot high observation
tower a panoramic view is easily gained. Picnic facilities, including stone
fireplaces, fuel wood, piped spring water and sanitary facilities are available.
A large rustic lodge with porch and portico provides protection from
sudden showers. Tenting on the top of Mt. Philo is not allowed.</p>
<h3 id="c9">THE GEOLOGY OF THE PARK</h3>
<h4><i>The Rocks</i></h4>
<p>The rocks of the Park which will probably first attract your attention
are those exposed at the main western Overlook which is located in the
summit area. This Overlook is found just northwest of the Park lodge
(see <a href="#fig8">Fig. 8</a>). These rocks are light to dark red or purplish in color, are
<span class="pb" id="Page_20">20</span>
primarily <i>quartzite with minor dolostone</i><a class="fn" id="fr_9" href="#fn_9">[9]</a>
dipping approximately 35 degrees
to the northeast (for an explanation of dip, see <a href="#fig3">Fig. 3</a> and text of
D.A.R. State Park, <a href="#Page_6">page 6</a>) and striking toward the northwest (for an
explanation of strike, see <a href="#fn_1">immediately preceding reference</a>).</p>
<p>A closer look at this Monkton Quartzite outcrop shows that it is
made up of several layers of rock (see <a href="#fig8">Fig. 8</a>). These layers, strata, or
beds are not all of the same thickness, but are generally from 1 inch to
1 foot thick. If an individual layer is traced over the extent of the outcrop,
it is found that its thickness remains about the same throughout.
It is therefore said to be regularly bedded. Thin laminations of dark red
shale are abundant and commonly define individual layers. A magnified
look at a specimen of this quartzite, under a hand lens, shows that it is
composed of fine to coarse fragments of quartz. Some of these fragments
have rounded edges, but others are quite angular. The spaces between
the fragments are filled with silica (quartz). Therefore, the rock
is said to possess a silica cement.</p>
<p>In many places where this Monkton Quartzite has been studied, features
attesting to a shallow water origin have been found. Among these
features are mud cracks, which form under alternating wet and dry
conditions; ripple marks, which are usually found only on shallow water
bottoms; and cross-bedding, which commonly forms in shallow water
areas.</p>
<p>The Monkton Quartzite underlies approximately a third of the Park
(see Geologic map, <a href="#fig9">Fig. 9</a>). This quartzite is between 250 and 300 feet
thick on Mt. Philo; however, the lower 50 feet or so consist predominantly
of white quartzite interbedded with dolostone. The age of the Monkton
Quartzite is considered to be Lower Cambrian (see Standard Geologic
Time Scale, <a href="#fig4">Fig. 4</a>).</p>

<p>A second type of rock is exposed in the south bank of the exit road
approximately 0.7 miles from the summit area. This is the <i>black</i><a class="fn" id="fr_10" href="#fn_10">[10]</a> to
bluish-black Stony Point Shale (see <a href="#fig10">Fig. 10</a>), which underlies the Monkton
quartzite. This shale, or hardened limy mud, is thinbedded and shows
abundant <i>cleavage</i><a class="fn" id="fr_11" href="#fn_11">[11]</a> parallel to the layers or beds. At this outcrop the
<span class="pb" id="Page_22">22</span>
layers strike to the northeast and dip 20 to 40 degrees toward the southeast.
The dip and strike of the Monkton Quartzite (see <a href="#fig9">above</a>) is not
similar to the dip and strike of the underlying Stony Point Shale. It
follows, that the layers of the Monkton Quartzite are not parallel to those
of the Stony Point Shale.</p>

<p class="pcap"><span class="sc">Fig. 10.</span> View looking south of cut-bank,
south side of exit road, about 0.7 miles
down from the summit parking area. Here the layers dip 20 to 40 degrees toward
the southeast and strike in a northeast direction. Note that the shale is thin-bedded
and contains numerous cleavage planes parallel to the layering. The handle of
the geologic pick is about 1 foot long.</p>
</div>
<p>The fact that these two units are not parallel could mean that the
Stony Point Shale was deposited, hardened into rock, uplifted, folded
and eroded, all prior to the deposition of the Monkton Quartzite. But,
first, what is the age of the underlying Stony Point Shale? If the story is
as listed above, the Stony Point Shale <i>must be older</i><a class="fn" id="fr_12" href="#fn_12">[12]</a>
than the overlying Monkton Quartzite. From the fossil animal remains found in the Stony
Point Shale, geologists have dated the Stony Point Shale as upper middle
Ordovician (see Standard Geologic Time Scale, <a href="#fig4">Fig. 4</a>). And so, here
we have older rocks (Lower Cambrian) resting on younger (upper
middle Ordovician).</p>

<p class="pcap"><span class="sc">Fig. 11.</span> View of Mt. Philo, looking toward the northeast. The black line approximates
the position of the thrust fault. The Monkton Quartzite, which is above
the line, was thrust westward over the Stony Point Shale (note the arrow). Line
A-B, <a href="#fig9">Fig. 9</a>, approximates the section.</p>
</div>
<h4><i>Structural Geology</i></h4>
<p>How can we explain this inverted order of rock units? The geologic
evidence presented in the Park does not indicate that folding of the
rocks was responsible. From the surface distribution of the two rock
types (see Geologic map, <a href="#fig9">Fig. 9</a>) and the nature of their contact with
each other, a fault relation is envisioned, in which older rocks were
thrust westward over the younger and thus to rest upon them (see <a href="#fig11">Fig. 11</a>).</p>
<p>We know the ages of both rock units involved in this thrust fault but
what is the geologic age of the actual thrust movement? Both the Stony
Point Shale and the Monkton Quartzite were hard rock when this thrusting
took place, therefore, the thrusting would have occurred later than
upper middle Ordovician time, but before late Silurian time. Two other
fault systems are recognized in or near the Park (see Geologic map, <a href="#fig9">Fig. 9</a>).
They are <i>high angle</i><a class="fn" id="fr_13" href="#fn_13">[13]</a>
faults which formed later than the thrust fault,
but still preceding late Silurian time.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_24">24</div>
<p>The Iberville Shale (this is not described in the section on &ldquo;The
Rocks,&rdquo; but is seen on the Geologic map, <a href="#fig9">Fig. 9</a>), which is questionably
exposed on the south side of Mt. Philo, would be the youngest rock
found in the Park. This shale is about 390 million years old. The most
recent faulting took place no later than about 340 million years ago.
There are no rocks in the Park which give us any positive geological
clues to the Park&rsquo;s history from the last episode of faulting to the Pleistocene
glaciers less than 1 million years ago. However, the fact that rocks
representing this interval of time are not present does indicate that the
area was above water during most of these 339 million years (this number
of years is very approximate). If any rocks were deposited during
this &ldquo;rock-gap&rdquo; period, they have since been washed away.</p>
<h4><i>The Pleistocene Deposits</i></h4>
<p>Beginning between 60,000 and 70,000 years ago two glacial advances
and retreats took place in the Champlain Valley. This was during the
most recent or the Wisconsin Stage of the Pleistocene Epoch. Scratches
or striations were cut into the overridden rock by rock debris carried
along at the base of the ice as it advanced (note the arrow in (&ldquo;br&rdquo;)
area at overlook in <a href="#fig12">Fig. 12</a>; this shows striation orientation, therefore,
the direction in which the glacier advanced). The glacial sediments found
on Mt. Philo were deposited during the final retreat of glacial ice, which
took place from 11,000 to 12,000 years ago. Most of the Park is covered
with these glacial deposits and by more recent soils.</p>
<p>Most of the glacial deposits found on Mt. Philo are classified as
glacial <i>till</i><a class="fn" id="fr_14" href="#fn_14">[14]</a>
(see Map of Glacial Deposits, <a href="#fig12">Fig. 12</a>), but other glacial
deposits are also mapped. A <i>kame</i><a class="fn" id="fr_15" href="#fn_15">[15]</a>
(designated &ldquo;K&rdquo; in <a href="#fig12">Fig. 12</a>) is a
glacial feature found in the southern part of the Park.</p>

<p>With the slow retreat of the glacial ice front from the Mt. Philo
region, deposits were left which indicate that a series of lakes formed
in front of the wasting ice mass. There is also evidence just west of Mt.
Philo (see &ldquo;bgm&rdquo; in <a href="#fig12">Fig. 12</a>) which indicates that just prior to the
formation of present-day Lake Champlain, an arm of the Atlantic Ocean
reached into the Champlain Valley from the St. Lawrence River region.
Lake-beach gravels (designated &ldquo;bg&rdquo; in <a href="#fig12">Fig. 12</a>) are found on both
the east and west slopes of Mt. Philo. The interesting fact about these
beach gravels is that they occur almost 500 feet above the present-day
level of Lake Champlain. Lake sand (designated &ldquo;ls&rdquo; in <a href="#fig12">Fig. 12</a>) is
found some 450 feet above Lake Champlain. This means that during a
<span class="pb" id="Page_26">26</span>
good portion of its recent geologic history, Mt. Philo was an island surrounded
by lake water. From the distribution of marine beach gravel
(designated &ldquo;bgm&rdquo; in <a href="#fig12">Fig. 12</a>), it appears that the invasion of sea water
from the St. Lawrence region did not isolate Mt. Philo as an island.</p>
<p>The complete story of the lake series is still not known, but, for the
most up-to-date treatment of this subject see D. P. Stewart&rsquo;s paper entitled
&ldquo;The glacial geology of Vermont&rdquo;: Vermont Geological Survey
Bulletin 19 (1961). Suggested also is C. H. Chapman&rsquo;s article entitled
&ldquo;Late glacial and postglacial history of the Champlain valley&rdquo; in the
American Journal of Science, 5th series, volume 34, pages 89-124
(1937). Looking out over the Champlain lowlands from the summit of
Mt. Philo leaves little doubt in the visitor&rsquo;s mind as to the prior existence
of lakes which surrounded Mt. Philo in the not too distant past (see
<a href="#imgx2">Cover</a> picture).</p>
<h4><i>Summary of the Geologic History</i></h4>
<p>During lower Cambrian time, the Monkton Quartzite and dolostone
followed by the Winooski Dolostone (not seen in the Park) were deposited
east of Mt. Philo State Forest Park. During late Cambrian and
early Ordovician, thick dolostones were deposited from the sea water
which covered the Mt. Philo area (not seen at the surface in the Park).</p>
<p>During middle Ordovician time, a series of shale, calcareous shale
and limestone was deposited from the sea water. Then, sometime between
the beginning of late Ordovician and late Silurian time, the eastern lower
Cambrian sequence was thrust westward over the middle Ordovician
rocks. This low-angle thrusting was succeeded by high angle faulting.</p>
<p>The Park rocks were subjected to weathering and erosion for over
300 million years or until glaciers advanced over the area less than
60,000 to 70,000 years ago. Advancing glaciers scoured the rock; retreating
or wasting glacial ice left deposits of clay, sand and gravel in
the Park. A series of lakes formed south of the northward wasting glacial
ice and deposits of beach-gravel and lake-sand formed along the slopes
of Mt. Philo, which was then an island. An arm of the sea next advanced
southward into the Champlain Valley leaving marine beach-gravels just
west of Mt. Philo. The marine waters retreated and present-day Lake
Champlain came into existence. The formation of the present soil cover
and the deposition of recent alluvium from presently flowing rivers and
streams concludes this brief summary of the Park&rsquo;s geologic history.</p>

<h3 id="c12">INTRODUCTION</h3>
<p>Sand Bar State Park is located in northwestern Vermont on U.S.
Route 2, approximately 14 miles north of Burlington and near the east
approach to Sand Bar Bridge which leads to South Hero Island in Lake
Champlain (see map, <a href="#fig1">Fig. 1</a>). Tenting, picnicking and swimming are the
Parks main attractions (<a href="#imgx7">Fig. 12a</a>). The swimming beach is on the north
side of U.S. Route 2 and fronts on Lake Champlain. Its shallowness
makes the beach safe for children (<a href="#fig13">Fig. 13</a>). The tenting facilities are
located on the south side of U.S. Route 2 on a south-facing shoreline.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_30">30</div>
<h3 id="c13">THE GEOLOGY OF THE PARK</h3>
<p>The geologic history of Sand Bar State Park is recent, geologically
speaking, especially when compared with that of the other Parks treated
in this pamphlet. The sediments of the park are blue and brown clay
which were deposited throughout the Champlain Valley less than 10,000
years ago. This clay, which can be seen in many places along the bathing
beach, was deposited from marine waters which flooded the Champlain
Valley just prior to the formation of present-day Lake Champlain.
No bedrock crops out in Sand Bar State Park.</p>
<p>The blue clay is covered with deposits brought downstream by the
Lamoille River during very recent times and deposited as a <i>delta</i><a class="fn" id="fr_16" href="#fn_16">[16]</a>
into Lake Champlain. This delta has shifted its distributary channels frequently
and continues to grow southwestwardly into Lake Champlain.
Much of the finer material (sand) brought into Lake Champlain by the
Lamoille River has been shifted and concentrated by lake currents into
ridges or bars; one sand bar stretches to South Hero Island and forms
the foundation for the causeway named Sand Bar Bridge. Prior to the
building of Sand Bar Bridge (causeway was started in 1849, opened to
travel on December 5, 1850), this sand bar was fordable and was used as
a link between South Hero Island and the mainland.</p>
<p>Most of the sand now found north of the Park bathing beach and
which is responsible for the extensive &ldquo;shallows&rdquo; in the swimming area,
was supplied by the now abandoned northern channel of the Lamoille
River. It is interesting to note that most of the sand now seen on the
bathing beach has been imported from nearby areas of Vermont. Since
the northern distributary channel of the Lamoille River is no longer
supplying sand, and sand from the active southern channel cannot work
its way northward because of the Sand Bar Bridge causeway, there is
a lack of sand for the beach.</p>
<p>The extensive swamp areas near the east end of Sand Bar Bridge are
a wildlife sanctuary. The north-trending prominent escarpment east of
the Park marks the trace of the Champlain thrust fault (<a href="#fig13">Fig. 13</a>). In a
quarry at the east end of Sand Bar Bridge may be seen the fault contact
between the younger, Middle Ordovician, Stony Point Formation, and
the older, Lower Cambrian, Dunham Dolomite.</p>

&ldquo;strike&rdquo; measurement is expressed as so many degrees east or west of north
or south. For a diagram illustrating the dip and strike of a rock layer see <a href="#fig3">Figure 3</a>.
</div><div class="fndef"><a class="fn"  id="fn_2" href="#fr_2">[2]</a>This is one of the three major rock groups or families.
The first consists of igneous rocks, including granite, syenite, and basalt, which were
formed by solidification of molten rock-material. The igneous rocks are ancestors of the
other two rock families; they form over 90 percent of the outer 10 miles of the
Earth&rsquo;s crust. The second family, consisting of sedimentary or layered rocks
including shale, sandstone and limestone, is composed of pieces and grains and
other materials from all the families of rocks. In addition, sedimentary rocks
are formed also from lime secreted by marine plants and animals or chemically
precipitated from sea water, or by the accumulations of shells. The third family,
metamorphic rocks, including gneiss, schist, slate and marble, were igneous or
sedimentary rocks that have been subjected to heat and pressure in the presence
of mineral-forming solutions. Metamorphic rocks generally look different from
the rocks from which they formed, because the original minerals of the rock
have been changed and reoriented.
</div><div class="fndef"><a class="fn"  id="fn_3" href="#fr_3">[3]</a>The actual remains
are usually not preserved in their original state but are
represented by molds and casts. Picture an ancient sea. The sea bottom mud
slowly hardens around a shell. Water then seeps through the hardened mud and
dissolves the shell leaving an open space where the shell once was. This open
space is a mold. If the mold is filled a copy of the original shell is formed. This
is called a cast.
</div><div class="fndef"><a class="fn"  id="fn_4" href="#fr_4">[4]</a>The relative
rather than the absolute age of the rocks can be determined
from a study of their fossil content. These fossils are compared with collections
from various places in the world where the standard geologic time scale assigns
them a place (see <a href="#fig4">Fig. 4</a>). The Park rocks were deposited during the Ordovician
Period. How is a standard geologic time scale put together? Several geologists
first worked out the sequences of rocks according to the Law of Superposition in
Great Britain and neighboring parts of Europe. When systematic collections of
fossils were made from these layers and arranged according to age it was found
that certain fossils occurring in rocks in distant areas were identical and occupied
the same relative age position. These fossils were considered to be of the same
relative age. Fossils found in the Park can be compared with these reference fossils
and a relative geologic age can be assigned to them. Absolute ages can be determined
in some cases by the use of rates of decay of radioactive elements and
in general these ages agree with the relative ages derived through the use of fossils.

is either a metamorphic or sedimentary rock consisting of fragments
of the mineral quartz (SiO&#8322;) which are cemented together by silica (quartz).
The combination of quartz fragments held together by quartz cement creates a
very hard rock which oftentimes will break across the fragments rather than
around them. The quartzites of the Park area are primarily of a sedimentary
origin. For a description of the three major rock groups, of which the sedimentary
and metamorphic groups are two, see footnote, D.A.R. State Park, <a href="#Page_6">page 6</a>. A
dolostone is a sedimentary rock composed of fragmental, concretionary, or precipitated
dolomite (a mineral of chemical composition, CaMg(CO&#8323;)&#8322;) of organic
or inorganic origin.
</div><div class="fndef"><a class="fn"  id="fn_10" href="#fr_10">[10]</a>The

after the layers had hardened into

the basic geologic law, the Law of Superposition, younger
rocks (those deposited last) are always found resting on older rocks (those deposited
before the younger). The only time that this is not true is when either
breaks (faults) or folds in the earth&rsquo;s crust place the layers in an inverted order,
as in the case here cited.

than 30 degrees) at its intersection with an imaginary horizontal plane.

is, made up of all the same sized particles) water deposited materials. Most kames
are ice-contact features; that is to say, the materials which make up the kame
were deposited in contact with a glacial ice surface. The Mt. Philo kame may be
the filling of an ice-free area during the final melting of the glacial ice.
